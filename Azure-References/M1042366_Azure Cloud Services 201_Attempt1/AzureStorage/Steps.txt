Steps taken to implement:
1. Wrote a powershell script that can be used as a template to deploy an Azure Storage account.
2. To enable HTTPS access only, the EnableHttpsTrafficOnly is set to true.
3. SKU restrictions and encryption are enabled by default.
4. Ran the script locally and deployed the storage account.
