1. Created an ARM template for deploying any Azure cosmos database. Created a database for each Cosmos database type.
2. Wrote functions to connect to each of the Cosmos databases created above. The functions also run insert / select queries for testing purposes.
3. Queried for the logs in the Azure portal for each Cosmos database (since they cannot be retrieved via code).
