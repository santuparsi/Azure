What is Cloud Computing?
========================
1.A way to deliver the computing as a service rather than a product.
2.It Provides on-demand hardware(like servers),storage resources,service hosting,service management environment and other devices as a resource over the internet.
3.It is a way to rend computing and storage from someone else datacenter(Microsoft having datacenters accross the world(india,us,japan,china etc))
4.Microsoft datacenter manage by Microsoft team.

Cloud Computing Advantages
==========================
1.High availability: Your cloud based application/services will always run with no downtime even when things go wrong.
2.Scalabiltiy:Cloud-based applications can be scaled in two-ways
	1.Vertically:Computing capacity can be increased by addin RAM or CPUs to a verticle machine.
	2.Horizantally: Computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource.
3.Elasticity:Cloud-based applications can be configured for auto scaling,so it will always have the resource when they needed.
4.Agility:cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as your applications requirements change.
5.Geo-Distribution: applications and data can be deployed to regional datacenters around the globe,so your customers always have the best performance in their region.
6.Disaster Recovery: Cloud-based applications data is replicated and geo-distribution make your data safe even a disaster occur.

Cloud Computing Offering
========================
1.IaaS:
	# Virtual Manchines and Storage
2.PaaS:
	#App-services ,Azure SQL is part of PaaS
3.SaaS:
	# Office 365,Visual Studion Online
	
Note: SaaS is costly than PaaS and PaaS is costly than IaaS
